OPTION 2) MUSIC PLAYLIST MANAGER

OBJECTIVE: Implement a Circular Doubly Linked List to manage a music playlist that supports continuous looping.

SCENARIO: You are creating a music playlist application. The playlist is circular, meaning it loops back to the beginning after reaching the end. You should be able to:
    - Add a song to the playlist.
    - Remove a song from the playlist.
    - Move to the next or previous song.
    - Display the current song and playlist.

REQUIREMENTS:
    - Add Song: Insert a song node into the playlist.
    - Remove Song: Delete a song from the playlist, adjusting links to maintain the circular structure.
    - Next and Previous: Move forward or backward through the playlist.
    - Loop Continuously: When reaching the end, the playlist should loop back to the first song.

import java.util.Scanner;

class Node {
    String data; // the actual data of the Node
    Node next; // connector to the next node
    Node prev; // connector to the previous node
    static int count = -1; // background counter to be used for making indices easier
    int index; // index for the node. this will make things easier when it comes to things like insertion and deletion

    Node (String data) { // attributes of a node:
        this.data = data; // it has data
        this.next = null; // it has a next node
        this.prev = null; // it has a previous node
        count += 1;
        this.index = count; // it has an index
    }
}

// now define that a LoopedList is composed of nodes...
class LoopedList { // because the classname DoubleCircularLinkedList is a bit too long...

    // ATTRIBUTES
    String name; // internal name of the looped list. just for fun. can have spaces and such; useful for playlists
    Node head = null; // first node of the looped list
    Node foot = null; // last node
    Node selected = null; // selected node. this kinda list can only ever have one selected node so i put it as an attribute of LoopedList instead of having isSelected as an attribute of Node like i had originally planned
    int length = 0; // length

    // CONSTRUCTOR
    LoopedList(String name) { // constructor; sets the name
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    // initialisation...
    // TAKE NOTE! this is a DOUBLY CIRCULAR linked list. so every node has two connections and it loops over in both directions
    void push(String newData) { // method to insert new data at the END of the LoopedList
        length += 1;
// being honest: almost of this code is from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-in-doubly-circular-linked-list/ and slightly modified. however the comments are all made by me since the original code didn't have any comments at all as to what it was doing and it was a pain to understand. of course that is not my style and i don't just insert code without having at least an understanding of how it works. i think i might have an understanding of what it is now

        Node newNode = new Node(newData); // make new node. this is the one we're going to be inserting

        if (head == null) {
            // if list is empty...
            // make new node
            newNode.next = newNode.prev = newNode; // set newNode's next and prev to itself. didn't know you can do double or n-tuple assignments in Java until now. #TheMoreYouLearn
            head = newNode; // then, set newNode as the head
        } else { // if the list is Not empty...

            // set the foot
            foot = head.prev; // set the list's foot as the previous node of the head

            // ensure it loops Forward correctly...
            foot.next = newNode; // with the old foot, connect it so that its next is the newNode
            newNode.next = head; // and then by default, it will be the new last element (foot) since it's inserted in the end, so set its next to loop back to the head so its loops in the forward direction

            // ensure it loops Backward correctly...
            newNode.prev = foot; // for the new node, since its the new one at the end of the list, set its previous node to the old foot
            head.prev = newNode; // then for the head, set its new prev to be the newNode
        }
    }

    void printList() { // method to print the data of all of the nodes in the list...
        if (head == null && length == 0) {

    } 

    // method to update indices after node deletion. funfact i added this because there was a bug in the first submission; after one deletion, subsequent deletions wont work because deletion is based on node indices, which.. weren't updated after a node in the middle was deleted. this fixes it
